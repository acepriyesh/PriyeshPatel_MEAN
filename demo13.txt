<div> block element.
<span> inline element 
        is not a block element, 
            it will not cover the null area.

What is the difference between div and P and span?
div and p are “block elements” (now redefined as Flow Content) 
and span is an “inline element” (Phrasing Content).
Yes, you may change the default presentation of these elements, 
but there is a difference between “flow” versus “block”, and “phrasing” versus “inline”.
