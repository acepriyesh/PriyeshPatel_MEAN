What is the difference between div and P and span?
div and p are “block elements” (now redefined as Flow Content) 
and span is an “inline element” (Phrasing Content).
Yes, you may change the default presentation of these elements, 
but there is a difference between “flow” versus “block”, and “phrasing” versus “inline”.

<div> block element. cover the whole block from left to right.
        can be seen when applying background color.

<div style="">
This style will be applied to whole division.
Be it color (to text)
or background color, which also can be customized with a different color to text.
Then whether we can style something differently within the division or not we will see later
and to experiment and see.

<span> inline element. only cover the area used. it will not cover the null/blank area.
        executes in the same line. 
        second span element can start just behind (on the right of) the previous one.
        can be seen when applying color.
