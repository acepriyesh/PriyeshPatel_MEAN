If you check github repo it will still only show the no. of branched you had,
in our case 1 (main),
before you just created 1 more new branch PriyeshP

now that we created more files with vscode in our folder with new branch.
cmd last state
--------------
>git branch
*PriyeshP
 main

Now lets save the changes to demo9.html and demo9.txt
then we follow the 4 steps.

>git init
>git add .
>git commit -m "added demo9"
>git push
fatal: The current branch PriyeshP has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use 

    git push --set -upstream origin PriyeshP

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream , see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

>git push --set -upstream origin PriyeshP
Enumerating objects: n, done
...

>

this should update our repo with the new branch after we commit and push the new branch
check it.
