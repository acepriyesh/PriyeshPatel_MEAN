Tables

Just putting text in a table like format in Headings and Paragraphs doesnt create tables.
It will just be a straight line with information in a repetitve layout.

For tables we use <table> tag as parent.
Its Children would be <tr> table rows.
Then define headings/columns for the table as <th> 
Our first table row ends </tr>.
The remaining <tr> table rows will be data and the data rows have <td> data tags.
</table> table close.

<th> tag makes the text <strong> or <bold>

We can always add more columns by adding to <tr> using <th>.
We can always add more rows as data by adding to <tr> using <td>

we can have a border in the table with
<table border="1"> ="1" is one of many types of borders possible.
                    Higher the number the thicker the outside border.

The rowspan and colspan are the attributes of <td> tag. 
These are used to specify the number of rows or columns a cell should merge. 
The rowspan attribute is for merging rows and 
the colspan attribute is for merging columns of the table in HTML.-Oct 18, 2022

merging two or more rows in a single column can be merged with rowspan  
use the span tag in upper row. <td rowspan"2"> spans to cover 1 row below
                               <td rowspan"3"> spans to cover 2 rows below

But the data and cells will appear outside of the defined table. 
Those can either be deleted or kept inside the <!-- Comments --> for future reference.

We can also merge two or more columns using the colspan in similar fashion.
merging two or more columns spans to the right.
delete or comment out the column on the right to tidy up the table.

For whole table at once.
Add space  inside cells with cellpadding.
<table cellpadding="10">

Add space inside the cells with cellspacing.
<table cellspacing="10">
