Create demo6.html and right clicked opened with vs code.

File will open blank but !-> enter for the basic structure.

in <body> add <h1> Just to check

Save.

Review by opening in browser.

Render: Just to check

Now to commit and push any new work/files 

Again:

Open Folder by 'File Explorer' in which the files you like to push to repo.
File Explorer -> Desktop -> meanhtml -> folder open inside which you have your files for repo.
Addressbar -> (delete file path) and type cmd -> enter
This is the folder you want to work with in cmd

c:\xxx\xxx\xxx\meanclasshtml>

Need do the only following 4 steps when for the second time.

1) git init				(initializes git)
2) git add .				( '.' adds all files from this particular folder (full directory) with any changes saved to any other files)
3) git commit -m "first commit" 	(commit to git with "suitable name")
	
*(4))git branch -M main -> No need again.
*(5))'git remote add origin' -> No need again because you are cummiting and pushing to the same repo as just now before.

4(6)) git push 				(push to git (as previously specified))
