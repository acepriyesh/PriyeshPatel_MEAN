Create a New Branch in an existing repo

Method 1) 

*a) create a new branch, give name and switch to it - in one command
	>git checkout -b newbranch name
		checkout: means change from branch,
		-b: means to the new branch im creating now
		"": with the name inside the quotes.

*b) check status of the branch you are in
	>git status

*c) check which branch we are in
	>git branch

cmd
---
*a>git checkout -b "newbranchname"
Switched to new branch "newbranchname"

*b>git status
On Branch newbranchname
nothing to commit, working tree clean

*c>git branch
*newbranchname
 main
-------------------------------------------
Method 2)

*a) check which branch in currently (not necessary)
	>git branch
		*branchnameyouareinnow
		 notinthisbranchwithoutasterisk
		 notinthatbranchwithoutasterisk

*b) create a new branch, give a name
	>git branch -c newbranchname
		git branch: we are dealing with branch
		-c:	create new branch
		newbranchname is the name it is having

*c) check which branch we are in (we are in * branch)
	>git branch
		*branchnameyouareinnow
		 notintheonejustcreated
		 notinthetwojustcreated

*d) change to branch desired
	>git checkout branchnamedesiredto
		checkout: means change from branch,
		branchnamedesiredto: to this franch

*e) check if we are in newbranchname, obviously we are but good practice to check
	>git branch
		*branchnameyouareinnow
		 notintheonejustcreated
		 notinthetwojustcreated

cmd
---
*a>git branch
* main

*b>git branch -c newbranchname
