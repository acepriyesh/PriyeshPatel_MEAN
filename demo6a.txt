As an exercise we deleted the existing repository.

Created a new repository

Created a new local folder with files

commit and push as like for the first time using cmd and git commands

create/update files and exercise for commit push second time using cmd and git commands

I did not delete my existing repo as it said 1 watcher,
So I created a new repo as: Priyesh_Mean as requested by Thaneshawara
then Created demo6a for exercise 1 - cmd -> first time git commands
then opened and edited demo6a with VSCode, save and do the cmd - git commands.
