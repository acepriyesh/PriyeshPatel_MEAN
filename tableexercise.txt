The <caption> tag defines a table caption. 
The <caption> tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag. 
Tip: By default, a table caption will be center-aligned above a table.

The Product Info Table
<table>

<caption>Product info<caption>

1) Identify no of headings required at the top and create as many rows (2)

<tr>    <th></th> <th></th>     <tr>

2) Create the remaining rows required. ()

<tr>    <td></td> <td></td>     <tr>
<tr>    <td></td> <td></td>     <tr>
<tr>    <td></td> <td></td>     <tr>
<tr>    <td></td>               <tr>

3) Give the first <td rowspan="3"> in the first <tr> for data
4) <!-- comment out the first <td> in the remaining <tr> s.

5) Give the <td colspan="2"> in the last <tr>

6) Give <table border="3" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5"

A simple school time table

1) Identify how many total rows required
2) Identify which ones are heading rows and which ones are data rows
3) Create structure
4) Enter data
5) Style with HTML
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practicing with the simple school table first paved the ways for creating the Highschool table.
Sameway this Highschool timetable will help create slightly more complex table structures.

A Highschool Time Table: Prototype 1

    Remember: Even the seasoned pros take more than one iteration.
                Things become perfect with trial, error and improvement.
                This guideline went through many trials, errors and improvements and research.
                Even then its not perfect as I'm just a student, for now.
                But I know how to teach what I know. 
                Teaching takes more effort than learning.
                Thank you teachers.
        Data can be entered in order of simplicity.
            e.g.by row covering each column in it.
                by first column in each row and any columns that span
                by columns only for all rows
                etc.
        Regularly check your table along as you construct it.
        Give your table a border the first thing so 
        you can see filled in and empty cells as you input data.

1) Identify and create total number of table rows required .
<table>
    1<tr></tr>  
    2<tr></tr> 
    3<tr></tr> 
    4<tr></tr> 
    5<tr></tr> 
    6<tr></tr> 
    7<tr></tr>
</table>

2) Identify total number of columns required in the table. Add as many headings in the first row.
1<tr>
    1<th></th>   
    2<th></th>   
    3<th></th>   
    4<th></th>   
    5<th></th>   
    6<th></th>   
    7<th></th>   
    8<th></th>   
    9<th></th>
1</tr>

3) Repeat above with table data for the remaining 6 rows.  
Note: the 1st column is days so you can give all first columns in all rows <th> tag for bold text.
        Also 5th column is also bold and text looks bigger. Consider <p>,<strong>, or <h3> 
    Otherwise it depends on what is the design structure, where individial <tr> tag may be styled accordingly.
    

    The remaining rows can look same if the structure is almost consistant.
    Adjust each row as needed as you enter data.
<tr>
        <th>Days</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
        <th>LUNCH</th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
<tr>

a) I entered days in first columns of all rows. Check table appearance.
b) then I entered time in the middle cloumn of first row and 'LUNCH' for all other rows. Check table appearance.
    LUNCH in vertical format can be dealt with later on.
    Always contruct your table first and format and style later.
c)  Now its easier to follow by either row or column. Remember to repeat spanning data for now.
    Format later.
    
    I started with row 2: Monday. Because I dont yet know how to have the Roman numbers above the times in columns.
    Check table appearance.
   
    Looks like giving cellpadding now is not a bad idea. 
        <table border="3 cellpadding"10">                                   Check table appearance
    
    Also caption for the table.
        <caption>High School Time Table</caption>                           Check table appearance

    I think not a bad idea to <colspan="3"> Lab cells right now.
        comment out the other two labs                                      Check table appearance

d) Do row Tuesday accordingly                                              
    started with <colspan="3"> and commented out other two labs
    and then after input Eng, Che, Mat, and SPORTS.                         Check table appearance

e) Wednesday, Mat, Phy, Eng, (LUNCH aready there (Smart!!)), Che
    then <colspan> for Librabry and comment out the other two.              Check table appearance

f) Thursday, Phy, Eng, Che, (LUNCH aready there (Smart!!)),
    then <colspan> for LAB, and comment out the other two, and Mat.         Check table appearance

g) Friday, <colspan> for LAB and comment out the other two.
     (LUNCH aready there (Smart!!)), Mat, che, Eng, Phy.                    Check table appearance

h) Saturday, Eng, Che, Mat, (LUNCH aready there (Smart!!)),
    then <colspan> for SEMINAR, and comment out the other two.              Check table appearance

*! Did you know I put data in cells even though theyre commented out!*

Looks like I should increase the padding.                                   Check table appearance

Now the parts I dont know how to do, so I will try to use my logic at first.

i) <rowspan="6">LUNCH on Monday and comment out the rest of the days.       Check table appearance
    I dont know how to do it vertical, I will try to figure out.

j) for the times I used <br> after the Roman numbers. 
    Although it looks right, but it may not be.                             Check table appearance

k) Dont know how to do 'LUNCH' vertical
    Also Dont know how to center the data.

Thats it for me I got it to look almost identical but not quite.
