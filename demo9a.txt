In the future, if you need to push to a particular branch,
follow:
1) check your branch with>git branch
2) change to desired branch> git checkout branchname
    -or create a new branch and then select the branch with git checkout (two options of -b and -c)
3) check and make sure the desired branch>git branch
4) git init
5) git add .
6) git commit -m "added demo9"
7) git push
    follow suggestions:
        --set-upstream origin branchname
        or
         To push to the upstream branch
on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD:main

To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD

To choose either option permanently, see push.default in 'git help config'.

To avoid automatically configuring an upstream branch when its name
won't match the local branch, see option 'simple' of branch.autoSetupMerge
in 'git help config'.
