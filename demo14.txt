<img> tag will need source to bring the content from
<img src="animal image

supposed to pad(copy) image address but NOT link address.

if image in diff local folder
go to properties only copy the file patch

src="underline if a link"
scr="from diff local folder no underline"




to have background image have it inside the <head> element.
