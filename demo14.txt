<img> tag will need source to bring the content from
<img src="animal image">

If the image or any file is in the same folder as your .html file:
        you only need to mention the file name with .xtn (its extension or file type)

If the image is located remotely on the web:
        you need to specify the image 
            NOT 'copy link address'.
            ^^^

if image in diff local folder
go to properties only copy the file path

src="copy image address" is correct.
src="copy link address does not work"

google: copy link address
firefox: copy link
